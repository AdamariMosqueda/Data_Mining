# Pearson Correlation
Pearson correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.

Pearson correlation is independent of the measurement scale of the variables. Pearson's correlation coefficient can be taken as an index that serves to measure the degree of relationship of two variables, for which both variables must be quantitative and continuous.

This coefficient is a measure that indicates the relative situation of the events with respect to the two variables, that is, it represents the numerical expression that indicates the degree of correspondence or relationship that exists between the 2 variables. These numbers vary between limits of +1 and -1.

Its dimension indicates the level of association between the variables.

When it is less than zero (r <0) It is said that there is a negative correlation: The variables are correlated in an inverse sense.
High values ​​in one of the variables usually correspond to low values ​​in the other variable and vice versa. The closer the value to -1 said correlation coefficient, the more evident the extreme covariation will be.

## Interpretation

This varies in the interval [-1,1], establishing the sign the sense of the relationship, and the interpretation of each result is as follows:

> If r = 1: Perfect positive correlation. The index reflects the total dependence between both variables, which is called a direct relationship: when one of the variables increases, the other variable increases in constant proportion.

> If 0 < r <1: Reflects that there is a positive correlation.

> If r = 0: In this case there is no linear relationship. Although it does not mean that the variables are independent, since there may be non-linear relationships between both variables.

> If -1 < r <0: Indicates that there is a negative correlation.

> If r = -1: It indicates a perfect negative correlation and a total dependence between both variables, which is known as an "inverse relationship", which is when one of the variables increases, the other variable decreases in constant proportion.

The correlation reflects the measure of association between variables. If applied in probability and statistics, the correlation allows us to know the strength and direction of the linear relationship that occurs between two random variables.
