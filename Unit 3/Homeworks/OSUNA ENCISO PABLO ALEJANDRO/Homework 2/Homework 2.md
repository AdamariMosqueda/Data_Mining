## Table

table uses the crossover factors to construct a contingency table of the counts at each combination of factor levels.

If the argument is not provided, the inner function is called to calculate the 'first names'. If the arguments are named, those names are used. For the remaining arguments, give an empty name, use the provided argument if it is a symbol, and the argument.

Only when specified (that is, not by default) and not empty, the factor argument levels might decrease.

## Scale

Scale is a generic function whose default method centers and / or scales the columns of a numeric matrix.

The value determines how column centering is performed. If it is a numeric-similar vector with length equal to the number of columns, then each column has the corresponding value of it. If then centering is done by subtracting the column means (omitting s) from their corresponding columns, and if it is, no

The value determines how column scaling is performed (after centering). If it is a numeric-similar vector with length equal to the number of columns of, then each column is divided by the corresponding value of. If it is done then the scale is done dividing the columns (centered) by their standard deviations if it is, and the root mean square otherwise. If it is, no stopover is made.
